Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹! <br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of my projects, "Chicken Charmer". After an 8-week training I attended, I made this game in a Gamejam organized by the organization that provided the training. And with this game i won the Gamejam.<br/><br/> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a simple snake game. To make the game more interesting, I designed the chicken as the head of the snake and the chicks as the body of the snake. Instead of a simple snake bait, I tried to enrich the visuals of the game with various vegetables. And in order not to disturb the integrity of the game, I designed the environment as a farm.<br/><br/> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to review, give your opinion about the game or comment you can reach me on my mail below. ðŸ‘‡<br/>
